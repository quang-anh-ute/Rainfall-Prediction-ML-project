# Rainfall-Prediction-ML-project

Predicting rainfall accurately may have the advantage of reducing the number of casualties and damage from natural disasters. 
Agricultural management and catastrophe avoidance can benefit from very precise rainfall prediction in specific situations, such as drought and flood. This study examines a number of different algorithms. Predicting rainfall is an effective use of data mining tools

## DATASET
The dataset contains about ten years' worth of daily weather observations from several places in Australia. The observations were systematically collected from various weather stations spread throughout different regions in Australia. The data is publicly available and can be accessed through the BoM's climate data portal at: ```http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data```

Objects: The primary objects of our dataset are daily weather observations recorded from multiple locations in Australia over the specified ten-year period.Features/Attributes: The dataset encompasses various meteorological parameters captured daily, serving as explanatory variables for our predictive model. 
These features include: ```MinTemp, MaxTemp, WindGusDir, WindGuSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Cloud9am, Cloud3pm,Temp9am, Temp3pm, RainToday,RainTomorrow.```
